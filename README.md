# Console

![](logo.png)

A minimal terminal for GNOME

Console is supposed to be a simple terminal emulator for the average user to carry out simple cli tasks and aims to be a ‘core’ app for GNOME/Phosh

We are not however trying to replace GNOME Terminal/Tilix, these advanced tools are great for developers and administrators, rather Console aims to serve the casual linux user who rarely needs a terminal

## Roadmap

- [ ] ‘API’ compatible with GNOME Terminal
    - [ ] Command line flags *Partial, supports -e/--command and --working-directory*
- [X] Command done notifications
- [X] ‘root mode’ turns red when sudo/su/pkexec is active in the terminal
- [X] ‘remote mode’ turns (purple?) when ssh is in use
- [ ] Other bash/shell integrations
