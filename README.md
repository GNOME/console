# Console / KGX

![](logo.png)

Console aims to be a simple terminal emulator for the average user to carry out casual cli tasks.

We are not however trying to replace GNOME Terminal/Tilix, these advanced tools are great for developers and administrators, rather Console aims to serve the casual linux user who rarely needs a terminal

## Use of Generative AI

*[Adopted from Loupe](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/loupe)*

This project does not allow contributions generated by large languages models
(LLMs) and chatbots. This ban includes tools like ChatGPT, Ollama, Claude,
Copilot, DeepSeek, and Devin AI. We are taking these steps as precaution due
to the potential negative influence of AI generated content on quality, as
well as likely copyright violations.

This ban of AI generated content applies to all parts of the projects, including, but not limited to, code, documentation, issues, and artworks. An exception applies for purely translating texts for issues and comments to English.

AI tools can be used to answer questions and find information. However, we encourage contributors to avoid them in favor of using [existing documentation](https://developer.gnome.org) and our [chats and forums](https://welcome.gnome.org). Since AI generated information is frequently misleading or false, we cannot supply support on anything referencing AI output.
